# Data-Mining

## Mining Knowledge from Customer Baskets
- In this project, we explore a dataset consisting of customer baskets containing products, prices, and transaction details. We use various data mining techniques to gain insights into the dataset and identify interesting patterns and associations.

## Data Transformation and Analysis
- We start by transforming the raw data into a usable format and analyzing it to gain a better understanding of the data. We perform data cleaning and preprocessing steps to prepare the data for further analysis.

## Learning Association Rules with the Apriori Method
- We apply the Apriori method with various parameters for the minimum support to identify frequent itemsets and association rules. We also use visualization techniques to explore and gain insights from the data.

## Clustering Transactions using K-Means Method
- We group transactions using the K-Means method, based on basket value attributes and recency days. We analyze the resulting clusters to gain insights into customer behavior and preferences.

## Combined Utilization of Methods: Description of Product and General Profile Groups using Association Rule
- We combine the Apriori method with K-Means clustering to identify interesting association rules between products and transaction groups. We use visualization techniques to explore and interpret the results.

**Overall, this project demonstrates the power of data mining techniques in analyzing large and complex datasets. Through visualizations and analysis, we gain valuable insights into customer behavior and preferences, which can be used to inform marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction.**
